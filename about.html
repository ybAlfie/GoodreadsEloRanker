        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This website helps you find which books from your "Want to Read" list you'd like to read next. 
            Using a series of one-on-one matchups, you compare two books at a time, choosing the one you’d rather read. 
            The website uses an ELO rating system (similar to Chess) to rank all your books, helping you decide what to read without having to compare each book individually.

        <h2>How to Use the Website</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start at the Upload Page:</strong> On the <a href="index.html">Upload</a> page, 
                you can upload your Goodreads Library Export CSV (or a previous rankings CSV if you have one). 
                This will import your "Want to Read" list.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/import">Click here</a> to export your library from Goodreads or go to "My Books", then click on "Import and export" under Tools.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Go to the Ranking Page:</strong> After uploading, go to the <a href="ranking.html">Rank Books</a> page. 
                Here, you’ll be presented with two books at a time. Choose which one you'd prefer to read by clicking the book or 
                pressing the corresponding arrow key.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Ranking:</strong> The system will continue to present matchups. Each choice updates the ELO ratings 
                for the books, refining the rankings with each decision.</li>
            <li><strong>View the Leaderboard:</strong> When you’ve made enough comparisons, visit the <a href="leaderboard.html">Leaderboard</a> 
                to see how your books stack up. You can also export your current rankings for future sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge Updated Files:</strong> If you’ve made changes to your Goodreads "Want to Read" list since your last session you can 
                    upload both the new Goodreads Library Export and your old rankings CSV together on the Upload page. 
                    The system will automatically update by adding new books, removing titles no longer in your want to read list, and preserving your previous ELO rankings.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <section id="faq-storage-privacy">
                <h3>Data Storage and Privacy:</h3>
                <p>
                    Data is saved locally in your browser’s LocalStorage. This means:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local-Only Storage:</strong><br>
                        No external servers are involved. All the rankings and book data you generate stay on your own device, inside your browser’s storage. 
                        When you revisit the site using the same browser and the same device, your previously ranked books and ELO scores should still be 
                        available without needing to re-upload your files.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong><br>
                        Because no data is sent online, privacy is maintained. Others cannot access your rankings unless they use your device and browser.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Portability and Backup:</strong><br>
                        If you want to take your rankings to another device or browser, you can export them as a CSV file. Without exporting, the data remains 
                        tied to the specific browser and device you’re using.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Loss Considerations:</strong><br>
                        LocalStorage can be cleared if you reset your browser’s data or run the site in a private/incognito window. Additionally, browser updates 
                        or certain privacy settings may occasionally wipe stored data. To avoid losing progress, make sure to periodically export your rankings 
                        as a CSV file.
